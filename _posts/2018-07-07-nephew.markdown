The son of a brother or sister. But the term, as used ln wills and other documents, may include the children of half brothers and sisters and also grand-nephews, lf such be the apparent intention, but not the nephew of a husband or wife, and not (presumptively) a nephew who is illegitimate. See Shephard v. Shephard, 57 Conn. 24, 17 Atl. 173; Lyon v. Lyon, 88 Me. 395, 34 Atl. 180; Brower v. Bowers, 1 Abb. Dec. (N. Y.) 214; Green’s Appeal, 42 Pa. 25
