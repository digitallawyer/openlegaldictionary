letter: E
permalink: "/definitions/usc-exemptions-exempt-property.html"
body: Certain property owned by an individual debtor that the Bankruptcy Code or applicable
  state law permits the debtor to keep from unsecured creditors. For example, in some
  states the debtor may be able to exempt all or a portion of the equity in the debtor's
  primary residence (homestead exemption), or some or all "tools of the trade" used
  by the debtor to make a living (i.e., auto tools for an auto mechanic or dental
  tools for a dentist). The availability and amount of property the debtor may exempt
  depends on the state the debtor lives in.
