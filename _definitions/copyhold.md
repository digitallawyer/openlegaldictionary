  title to whlch consists of the copies of the court rolls, which are* made out by
  the steward of the manor, on a tenant’s belng admitted to any parcel of land, or
  tenement belonging to the manor. It is an estate-at the will of the lord, yet such
  a wlll as is agreeable to the custom of the manor, which customs are preserved and
  evidenced by the rolls of the several courts baron, in which they are entered. 2
  Bl. Comm. 96. Iu a larger sense, copyhold is said to Import every customary tenure,
  (that is, every ten-ure pending on the particular custom of a manor,) as opposed
  to free socage, or free-hold, which may now (since the abolition of knlght-service)
  be considered as the gen-eral or common-law tenure of the country. 1 Steph. Comm.
